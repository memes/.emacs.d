# This DTD defines the Weblogic specific deployment information for defining
# a deployable Resource Adapter Connection Factory.  It provides for complete
# specification of all configurable Connection Factory parameters including
# Connection Pool parameters, Security parameters for Resource Principal Mapping
# and the ability to define values for configuration parameters which exist in
# the ra.xml deployment descriptor.

# The weblogic-connection-factory-dd element is the root element of the
# Weblogic specific deployment descriptor for the deployed resource adapter.
